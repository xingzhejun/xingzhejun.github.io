Hi to everyone who is visiting my homepage!

Currently I am a third-year master's student from Tsinghua University, China. I major in Artificial Intelligence. I am looking for a Ph.D. posiiton from 2026 Fall, so don't hesitate contacting me if there is a match!

In general, my research interests lies in Reinforcement Learning, Generative Models (especially in vision and language), and their potential intersection with Robotics, but I am also open to a variety of interesting problems. My research goal is to advance the capabilities of AI agents to interact with the (physical) world, with a special emphasis on leveraging generative models.
