Hi to everyone who is visiting my homepage! I just developed this page recently, and I know there are many parts missing. But please keep an eye on it! I will update it as soon as possible!

Currently I am a third-year master's student from Tsinghua University, China. I major in Artificial Intelligence. Prior to that, I obtained my bachelor from Department EE, Tsinghua University. I also once exchanged at TUM, Germany.

I am looking for a Ph.D. posiiton from 2026 Fall, so don't hesitate contacting me if there is a match!

In general, my research interests lie in Reinforcement Learning, Generative Models (especially in vision and language), and their potential intersection with Robotics, but I am also open to a variety of interesting problems. My research goal is to advance the capabilities of AI agents to interact with the (physical) world, with a special emphasis on leveraging generative models.
